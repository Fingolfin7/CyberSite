For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.","severity":"High","ref":"https:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/documents\/sources\/TheCLASPApplicationSecurityProcess.pdf\nhttps:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/74.html","cvss":"7","cve":""},{"cwe_id":"75","title":"CWE-75 - Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)","poc":"","desc":"The software does not adequately filter user-controlled input for special elements with control implications.","severity":"Info","ref":"https:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/75.html","cvss":"0","cve":""},{"cwe_id":"76","title":"CWE-76 - Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements","poc":"","desc":"The software may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete.

The most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing. The attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program. Alternately, the attacker can supply the address of an important call, for instance the POSIX system() call, leaving arguments to the call on the stack. This is often called a return into libc exploit, since the attacker generally forces the program to jump at return time into an interesting routine in the C standard library (libc). Other important data commonly on the stack include the stack pointer and frame pointer, two values that indicate offsets for computing memory addresses.
